                  - Finished the function code for finding the position of letter based on user inputs. 
                  - finished the function code for finding      
                  - Made a function To find the position of a letter lastly mentioned in the string.
                  - Made a function To remove the empty space in the string.

                  - Since already having more than enough experience on them, while learning the C++ not going to test the same syntax again. 
                  - Gone through the functions. Already know the syntaxes. Not testing again. 
                  - Already aware of Ternary Operator, Variable Scopes and template literals, and eString(). Not testing them again.
