To learn JavaScript coding, I am going to try the tutorial video from the YouTube channel "Bro Code" and test the codes along with it on my end in different ways for a better understanding.

- Already aware of Ternary Operator, Variable Scopes and template literals, and eString(). Not testing them again.
- Made a FAQ note for everything to do a quick revision.

Practice Day 9 - Number Guessing game at 2:03:15 - Assignment - pending
- Practice program to convert the temperature - 2:07:14 - Assignment - pending

Practice Day 10 - Number Guessing game at 2:03:15 - Assignment - Completed now
- Already aware about the array and the it's usage. Hence not testing it again.
- Already aware about the 2D arrays and it's usages. Hence not testing it again.
- Need to test the rest parameters in 2:35:00.
- Call back function methoad is already aware. Hence not testing it again.

Practice Day 11 - Have intiated a repository for Learning React
Practice Day 12 - Have intiated a repository for Learning MySQL
Practice Day 13 - Have covered the topics in Bro code till 4:40:35.
- Also, made a small program to test the try and catch methoad which was explained in duration 4:02:58

- Added the Interactive Stop Watch to the pending assignment. 
- Change of plans. I planning to make a extra JS sheet which has the functions that can create an output in the HTML file. I will import this file to each JS sheet that I am working and contole output within the JS sheet with less codes.

- Added an addition function in the custom made js sheet to create index elements with the hyper link attached to it.  (export function Create_index(i,name,link,id))
-
