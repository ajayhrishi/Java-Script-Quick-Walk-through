I am learning JavaScript coding by following the "Bro Code" YouTube channel tutorial. Here is a summary of my daily practices:

Day 1: Basic HTML, input/output, and console outputs with some CSS properties.

Day 2: Tested arithmetic operations on variables.

Day 3: Created a simple function to test out the const keyword and tested Math functions by creating a user-friendly webpage. Also, assigned works to their respective folders.

Day 4: Tested a function to find the length of the third side of a triangle.

Day 5: Tested a simple counter label function that can be adjusted with increase, decrease, and clear buttons.

Day 6: Created a page to do string operations and functions to calculate the string length, finding the letter in position 'x', finding the position of a letter, finding the position of the lastly mentioned letter in the string, removing the empty space in the string, converting a string to uppercase, converting a string to lowercase, removing a specific letter from the string, and replacing a specific letter from the string with another letter.

Day 7: Tested the string slice method and method chaining in JS.

Day 8: Revised loops, functions, Ternary Operator, Variable Scopes, template literals, and eString(). Made a FAQ note for quick revision.

Day 9: Pending assignments for the number guessing game and temperature conversion program.

Day 10: Completed the number guessing game assignment. Tested rest parameters and nested functions.

Day 11: Initiated a repository for Learning React.

Day 12: Initiated a repository for Learning MySQL.

Day 13: Covered the topics in Bro code till 4:40:35. Made a small program to test the try and catch method.

Day 14: Made a page for testing the try and catch method.

Day 15: Made a page for testing the setTimeout().

Day 16: Made a page for testing the setInterval().

Day 17: Made a page for testing the DayFunctions and tried making a live time output using the setInterval functions. Tested different getTime functions, made functions for giving tags and formats for time elements, and made functions for editing the year, month, date, hour, minute, and second on the saved date.

Day 18: Covered the full video of the Bro code tutorial and added the Interactive Stop Watch to the pending assignment. Planned to make an extra JS sheet for controlling output within the JS sheet with fewer codes.

Day 19: Worked on adding more functions to create Inputbox, Radio buttons, and checkbox button with CSS properties to the JS module.

Day 20: Finished creating the JS module for future practices.

Day 21: Added some more different style button maker function in the JS module, finished testing the spread operator with arrays, and updated the index page with the custom-made JS module. Added an additional function in the custom-made JS sheet to create index elements with the hyperlink attached to it.

Day 22: Going to Quickly test all functions to finish Infosys' Springboard Data Structures and Algorithm video on JavaScript. This knowledge will enhance coding with user inputs. 
- Tested the Rest parameter method in console now.
